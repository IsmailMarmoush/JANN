	// Original andrewNG alg alpha/m * SIGMA((output-y)*x)
	// To generalize (for any n outputs ) alpha/(m*output.length) * SIGMA...

	// sigma and m were removed to be added according to the algorithm
	// (batch or Stochastic) so the arguments should be a vectors in either
	// cases inputs are inserted one by one there shouldn't be input matrix
	// where m-rows equal the number of training sets the perfomance speed
	// shall be same for both techniques untill investigated and proven
	// otherwise
	// TODO investigate input as a Matrix (works with batch only) vs list of
	// inputs(works with batch or stochastic)
