Current release is Jann-0.4 and it's in preAlpha phase of production so many changes will sure 
happen.

Jann depends on several libraries They're all included in jann/Lib folder:
1-JBlas + Javadocs
2-JGrpah + Javadocs

The SoftwareEngineering Folder includes UML, MachineLearning Notes, and links to large resources

If you find Jann-0.x.jar big know that it's because of some of the libs files for example
JBlas contains 3 folders of native libraries (Linux.so, Mac.jnilib, Windows.dll) each of one
is around 5 MB, also consider Javadoc jar files. The Jann source by it self won't pass the 400KB 
but anyway I don't think size is a problem this days. Anyway you can message me to figure out some
optimizations.
