Jann depends on several libraries:
1-JBlas + Javadocs
2-JGrpah + Javadocs


They're all included in Lib folder
The SoftwareEngineering Folder includes UML, MachineLearning Notes, and links to large resources

If you find Jann-0.x.jar big know that it's because of some of the libs files for example
JBlas contains 3 folders of native libraries (Linux.so, Mac.jnilib, Windows.dll) each of one
is around 5 MB

Also the Javadocs.jar file are big

The Jann source by it self won't pass the 400KB but anyway I don't think size is a huge problem
this days. unless you're planning to use jann on a mobile application which is beyond the scope currently.
